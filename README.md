# CSH Map

## Overview
An internal site of RIT's [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu) that shows the occupants of each room in CSH, both Nathaniel Rochester Hall and Helen Fish Hall. It's hosted on our internal [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/), built using [Flask](flask.pocoo.org), and pulls directly from CSH's LDAP server, so it'll show future occupants of rooms automatically, with no hard-coding necessary.

## Screenshots
CSH Map is an internal site, and thus not public-facing, however below are some screenshots showing how the site looks and works.
